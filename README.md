# Encore Atlas

Encore Atlas is a web-based companion app for revisiting live music experiences — focusing on memory, context, and emotional connection rather than pure discovery.

## Why this exists
Most music products optimize for what’s next. Encore Atlas explores how people reconnect with music through past experiences: the shows they attended, the people they were with, and the moments that stuck.

## What this repository contains
- A progressive web app (PWA) built for web and mobile
- Product artifacts documenting discovery, validation, and delivery decisions
- An evolving codebase built iteratively using AI-assisted workflows

## Product Artifacts
- Problem Statement
- Jobs To Be Done
- Personas
- User Journeys
- Validation Plan
- Story Map
- PRD
- Roadmap

(Links will be added as artifacts are created.)

## Status
Early development — actively building MVP.
